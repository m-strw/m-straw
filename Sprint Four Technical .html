    <p> My Approach to Problem-solving.</p>

    <p>
        Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:
        Got blocked on a simple problem syntax error, after doing one of my kata’s I called my mum as I thought it was funny how I spent so much time being stuck on a syntax error. This is how I explained it to her, computers are smart mum but the information they receive needs to be perfect other wises it doesn’t understand what it needs to do. A syntax error is just that the computer doesn’t register what I have written so it wouldn’t do what I needed to do. 
    </P>
    <p>
        Solved a problem in an elegant way, I have created a system to solve the problem that I face it’s basically a checklist of things to do. I think that by refining this as my knowledge of what to look out improves I think I will be able to solve problems in an elegant way more often. 
        For this problem, I used the rubber duck method I explained what I needed to do and then talk through everything that I could think that might stop it from working then I went through and checked each point until I found one that worked. I learned that in tests it needs to be written the same way that the test is set up to look for.

    </p>
    <P>Pseudocode</P>
    <p>
        Is where you write the steps to follow and what it is that you are doing I found it best to break it into the smallest steps possible then work out from there, this allows for more. 
    </p>

    <p>The Rubber Ducky Method.</p>

    <p>
        Where you speak though the problem to yourself in the hope that you will get a better understanding of the problem and then be able to see the answer to it through having to explain it in its aspect of the problem you can often see what you need to do improve it. 
    </p>
    
    <p>Reading error messages</p>
    <p>    
        This was made easier when I was in repl as the error messages were often specific. I think that I would often be looking too closely at what it was saying and where it could be applied moving forward I think that I will break it down into a test to try and fix the error messages   
    </p>
    <p>Console.logging</p>
    <p>    
        This was very helpful, especially when looking at the first two sections of the kata’s as it really made it easy to figure out what to do next, as the katas got harder such as fizz buzz you often had to write more code to figure out what was wrong or what to do next which made me use other things I had learned such as Pseudocode to break down the sections.      
    </p>

      
    <p>Googling</p>
    <p>    
        I am a lot better at this however I think it is an important skill to learn more of, I sometimes would use what I could find through googling to help me understand where to start, and then It was a bit harder to find answers to more specific issues I was having.  
    </p>

    <p>Asking your peers for help</p>
    <p>    
        I am lucky to have been doing the foundations sections from the dev academy this meant that I was able to ask for help and work on issues with peers both receiving help and offering it this helped me better understand more context for this.  
    </p>

    <p>Asking coaches for help</p>
    <p>    
        I had to do this at one point when I was hit with the syntax error as I just couldn’t see it. I was worried that I might look stupid but I thought that I would prefer to have finished the exercise then look stupid.  
    </p>

    <p>Improving your process with reflection</p>
    <p>    
        I saw the notes that another student was taking and have started doing the same thing as I feel that I would be a lot more comfortable with the content the more time I spent learning it.
