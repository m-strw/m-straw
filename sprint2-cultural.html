    <h1>Sprint Two Cultural
    </h1>
    <h3>11 September 2020</h3>

  <p>
    My career in a traditional sense I hope looks like this, I want to make lots of different products over my lifetime to help others.  </p>
  <p>
    I want to spend time working on the design of the products, I want to spend time on the development and building of the product and the sales of the product.  </p>

  <p>
    The human skills I would like to develop at EDA are the following, focus and communication.
  </p>

  <p>
    I will manage my workload by breaking down my day into different tasks and focus points with 45 mins of intense work followed by a 5-minute break, working with others by hearing what they have to say and working towards a common goal.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I need help, I will spend a maximum of 2 hours before I reach out to others. for those who are here to help me, I expect them to be honest and open with me.
