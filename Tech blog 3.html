    <h2>
        JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
    </h2>

    <p>
        HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript. CSS is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout. JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements. I like to think about the relationship between HMTL, CSS, and Javascript in terms of a jacket. Html is the material that is cut into the shape and design by using CSS and javascript is the zip and the buttons on the jackets that govern the behaviors, how it is used/worn.

       <h2>
           Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects
        </h2>
        Objects represent a special data type that is mutable and can be used to store a collection of data (rather than just a single value). Arrays are a special type of variable that is also mutable and can also be used to store a list of values.
        Control flow is in computer science the order that the instructions or statements or functions are executed.
        These are similar to the steps that need to be taken when baking something, and the loops are the different instructional steps that you need to use to bake the goods. Loops start and finish in a way that works so that they are able to make that you bake they good correctly so you can exit a loop when you have cooked it enough.

       <h2>Functions are and why they are useful.
        </h2> 
        A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it). In JavaScript, a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name, and then execute it as many times as you want. A JavaScript function can be defined using a function keyword.
        Like the program itself, a function is composed of a sequence of statements called the function body. Values can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value. In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any other object.

        <h2>The DOM and DevTools
        </h2>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page
        A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

        Manipulating/Changing the DOM means using this API to change the document (add elements, remove elements, move elements around, etc...). Traversing the DOM means navigating it - selecting specific elements, iterating over groups of elements

        DevTools give developers access to the internal workings of the web browser and web apps. Using DevTools you can know the styles that are used, the size of the images, the scripts that are used, etc. You can debug and know what errors exist on the page.
