    <h1>My Identity, Values and Strengths
    </h1>
    <h3>11 September 2020</h3>

  <p>
    Growing up I struggled with Dyslexia, I couldn’t see any action being taken by the people working in the education space to change things for dyslexic students outcome. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I wanted to do something about that as it is something that affects 10% - 20% of the general population and myself included. I thought that if I did something that I would be made fun of and people wouldn’t take me seriously enough to make a change. I was struggling a lot at school when I was thinking about this at the age of 12. I then decided to make a website with all the information that I found helpful and also created a lot more information that I wish I knew when I was younger. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Even though other students made fun of me, I still decided to do this as I didn’t want any other students to feel the same way as I did growing up. I felt the value of adventure and empathy was enough to make me do something like this. 

    The consequences of this action were that I was able to help over 120,000 students within New Zealand and worldwide with Dyslexia. The kids that were making fun of me were then asking how I was able to do what I did as they wanted to something similar. 

    My family and my culture has influenced me as I wouldn’t have done it if it wasn’t for their support, and also the attitude of just giving things a go. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The values of culture were always of one learning and education, and always giving things everything that you’ve got. I was taken to business conferences with my mum at the age of 12, to learn how to become an entrepreneur. 

    Some of the limits that I have within myself as my writing ability, with the right tools I have been able to somewhat overcome this however it is something that takes me some time to achieve and do. 

    Some of the strengths that	will help me with my career are that I have a high aptitude for seeing patterns and big picture thinking. As I had my learning skills tested with dyslexia when I was 8 I was scoring the age of a 28-year-old with pattern recognition and 24 years old with big picture thinking.  So my skills of this are something that I have leveraged within the work I was able to see the big picture impacts of the learning and create patterns for them to follow to get the outcomes they needed. I am also able to see the patterns within the human behavior of the people that I was working with I was able to anticipate their reactions to different information and the impacts of what they were doing. I also had to do a lot of public speaking, this was something that these skills help me out with a lot as it meant that I created patterns within my talks to help them with the outcomes that were needed from my talks.
