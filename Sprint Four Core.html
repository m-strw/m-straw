    <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset Blog</h2> 

    <p>
        Neuroscience and Growth Mindset was very important concepts for this part of the sprint and feel this will continue on. My understanding of Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset is the ability of neural networks in the brain to change through growth and reorganization. These changes range from individual neurons making new connections, to adjustments like remapping of the brain.

        Practically it means that you can improve aspects of your brain and your ability to get better at different skills over time. A growth mindset means that your most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. My perspective is that neuroplasticity is the science that backs up the growth mindset and that is more how you can benefit from neuroplasticity.
