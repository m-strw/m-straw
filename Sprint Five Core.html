    <h1>An Intro to Relative, Absolute, and Fixed Position
    </h1>
    
    <p> What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
    </p>

    <p>
        From doing the core learning I have learned a lot about my ego, these are some of the insights. I have found that I want to be the best it feels like I am failing which is an important insight as everyone learns things at different speeds and at different times I just need to be patient with my progress and reflect on what I have learned. 
    </P>
    <p>
        What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
    </p>
   
    <p>
        The role of values is that when looking at doing different projects and engaging with other students I will be working with my values first. This means that I will be able to work on ethical projects, and treat others well. 
    </p>

    <p>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</p>

    <p>
        The two things that surprised me were my values and how they turned out to be a bit different from what I thought they would be. I didn’t think it would be this hard to do the core work as well it is hard to look into yourself with such introspection. 
    </p>
    
    <p>What were the most challenging aspects of core learning?</p>
    <p>    
        Reflection on my ego and I believe it to be something different to how it is phrased in these questions. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </p>
    <p>    
        The hire rate for students with a high EQ would be better than ones with a low EQ and also the school doesn’t want students to work on unethical projects. 
    </p>

      
    <p>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </p>
    <p>    
        To be honest, I feel like the time writing about them feels like a waste of time but the work its self seems that I would be better off doing it in groups as it would be better to get a feel for the types of things that other students are thinking about when being asked the questions so that you are able to think about a situation or a question from more perspective than just your own. 
    </p>
